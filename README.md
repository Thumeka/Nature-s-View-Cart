# Introduction
Nature's View Cart is an e-commerce platform that allows users to register, login, add products to the shopping cart, and remove products from the shopping cart. Natureâ€™s view cart will permit only an authenticated user to access the home page. It emphasizes a seamless shopping experience, focusing on the health and environmental benefits of organic products.

Here is a live demo of Nature's view cart - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i2w79hHHRIKMv_UuMY2XnkYJ-lBgFUaz/view?usp=sharing
